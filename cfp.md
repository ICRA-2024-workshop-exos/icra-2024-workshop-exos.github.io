title: Call for Contributions
---

The primary objectives of this workshop are to **explore the breadth of cutting edge research related to exoskeleton and discuss future directions and interdisciplinary needs**. If your work aligns with this this area and you would contribute and benefit from our discussions, please submit or attend.

Broadly, we solicit contributions from those working on cutting edge research in the exoskeleton domain. We welcome contributions from anyone working in this space, in academia, industry, or medicine, and in any exoskeleton specialty, including sensing, hardware and actuation design, controls, human-factors and clinical utilization. Those with accepted posters will present in the middle of the workshop, as outlined in the [program schedule](../schedule), to provide opportunities for networking and interdisplinary discussions related to the workshop theme.

We hope to attract contributions from a wide range of engineering, computer science, psychology, physical and occupational therapy, and other related fields, so if you work in this space, don't hesitate to submit directly or [reach out](../contact) with any questions.

**Submission Content**

In addition to four expert talks, we also welcome poster submissions for student research related to emerging exoskeleton technologies ready to contribute to a dialogue of where exoskeleton reasearch is heading and the interdisciplinary efforts necessary to tackle emerging challenges. 

Submissions consist of 2 pdf documents, the first is the research poster to present, guidelines will follow those for paper submission presentations. The second is a teaser slide with **only** three elements. 1) A key image related to your work. 2) The research field (e.g. sensing, hardware, controls, clinical utilization). 3) The question that you've answered or are exploring. What is the interesting research question or objective that will make people interested in your poster? **???DO WE WANT TO MAKE A TEMPLATE???**

**Submission Link**

Poster Submissions (alongside attestations of planned conference travel to enable us to plan hybrid logistics) should be submitted via [this form](https://forms.gle/yrDUjWepNH2Pv1NE8). Contributions will be accepted on a **rolling basis** until **September 1, 2023**. To enable potential contributors to plan travel to and registration for the IROS 2023 conference, we guarantee responses by **September 15, 2023**.
