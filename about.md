title: About this Workshop
---

The research space around exoskeletons are varied and diverse, including research in sensing, mechanical design, control, and clinical utilization. Areas of specialization are also centered around the area of the body the exoskeleton targets and the use-case, varying from healthcare, military, to industry support.

The desired outcomes of this workshop are to:
- to bring together researchers in a common applciation space but a variety of research areas, providing a space for networking and discussion in order to foster interdisciplinary collaborations
- provide a space to share and receive feedback on cutting-edge and on-going research
- fascilitate discussions on the emerging research areas and technologies related to exoskeletons as well as the bottlenecks which require interdisciplinary teams

## Workshop Format ##
Our proposed format consists of four talks from prominent researchers and student posters followed by a panel discussion. The four talks center around prominent areas of exoskeleton research, sensing, mechanical design, control, and clinical utilization. 

Speakers are asked to not only present on their research areas in their respective areas, but also their perspective on future areas of growth, and well as bottlenecks that may be addressed by complmentary research areas or interdisciplinary endevors. 

The poster session provides a platform for students to present and receive feedback in various stages of the research process and network with fellow researchers working in the same application domain and similar or complementary research fields. 

The workshop finishes off with a panel discussion to bring the four speakers together to discuss emerging research areas and new technologies, within thier own domain and in an interdisciplinary context.
