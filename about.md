title: About this tutorial
---

To effectively make robots for humans, it is necessary to incorporate various human-subjects experiments - study of human-robot interactions, human utilization and learning, and human feedback and impressions. However, the key experiment designs and analyses of human subjects testing are often absent in training in prominent departments of roboticists, such as computer science, mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering, leaving many of these topics to self-study.

This tutorial is to bridge this gap by providing:
- an overview and framework of human subjects experiments
- an archive of quality resources for further learning and reference for novice roboticists

The desired outcomes of this tutorial are to:
- connect the next generation of roboticists with peers and prominent researchers in their field who are also working in human-subjects sub-fields
- provide active practice in experiment design
- provide tools for further study and reference

## Tutorial Format ##
Our proposed format consists of four talks from prominent researchers and student posters followed by a panel discussion.
