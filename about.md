title: About this Workshop
---

The research space around exoskeletons are varied and diverse, including research in sensing, mechanical design, control, and human utilization. Areas of specialization are also centered around the area of the body the exoskeleton targets and the use-case, varying from application domains such as human augmentation, rehabilitation, and injury prevention.

The desired outcomes of this workshop are to:
- to bring together researchers in a common application space but a variety of research areas
- provide a space for networking in order to foster interdisciplinary collaborations
- provide a space to share and receive feedback on cutting-edge research
- fascilitate discussions on the emerging research areas and technologies related to exoskeletons, focusing on bottlenecks requiring interdisciplinary solutions

## Workshop Format ##

**Talks:** Our proposed format consists of four talks from prominent researchers and student posters followed by a panel discussion. The four talks center around prominent areas of exoskeleton research: sensing, mechanical design, control, and human utilization. 

Speakers are asked to not only present on their research areas in their respective areas, but also their perspective on future areas of growth and bottlenecks that may be addressed by complmentary research areas or interdisciplinary endeavors. 

**Poster Session:** The poster session provides a platform for researchers to present and receive feedback in various stages of the research process and network with fellow researchers working in the same application domain and in similar and complementary research fields. 

**Speaker Panel:** The workshop finishes with a panel discussion to bring the four speakers together to discuss emerging research areas and new technologies within the interdisciplinary community of exoskeleton research.
