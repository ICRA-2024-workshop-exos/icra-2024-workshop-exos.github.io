**[Shuo-Hsiu (James) Chang](https://med.uth.edu/pmr/2022/10/28/shuo-hsiu-james-chang-pt-phd/)**, PT, PhD, MBA, UT Health, TIRR Memorial Hermann

Dr. Chang is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and a scientist and administrative director of the NeuroRecovery Research Center at TIRR Memorial Hermann. A physical therapist from Taiwan, he received his master’s and doctoral degrees in human movement science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an MBA in Healthcare at George Washington University. In 2005, he was awarded a Fellowship in Geriatric Research Award from the American Physical Therapy Association Section on Geriatrics for significant contributions to geriatric research. As a human movement specialist, his research and clinical interests include rehabilitation technologies and neuromotor recovery. Dr. Chang’s current research focuses on the effects and underlying mechanisms of robotic-assisted rehabilitation and neuromuscular modulation on mobility and community integration.

**[Maegan Tucker](https://maegantucker.com/)**, PhD, Georgia Institute of Technology

Dr. Tucker completed her PhD in the Mechanical and Civil Engineering Department at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in May 2023 and will be starting as an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech in January 2024. Her research is centered around developing systematic methods of achieving stable, robust, and natural bipedal locomotion on lower-body assistive devices, as well as developing human-in-the-loop methods to customize the experimental locomotion based on subjective user feedback. Specifically, Maegan's research has been applied towards achieving dynamically stable crutch-less exoskeleton locomotion for individuals with complete motor paraplegia on the Atalante lower-body exoskeleton.
